# Rubik’s Cube – 3D Cube Simulator in C++

This application is a fully interactive 3D simulation of the classic **Rubik’s Cube**, developed in **C++** using **OpenGL** for rendering and **GLFW** for window/context management. It allows users to visually explore, manipulate, and rotate the cube in real-time with smooth animations and responsive controls.

## 🧩 Features

- 🎨 **Real-time 3D rendering** of a 3x3x3 Rubik’s Cube using modern OpenGL
- 🎥 **Intuitive camera movement** — orbit, zoom, and pan for full control
- 🎮 **Interactive cube rotation** via keyboard and mouse inputs
- 💾 **I/O system** to save and load cube states or move sequences
- 🧱 **Object-oriented architecture** with a `RubiksCube` class managing all 27 sub-cubes
- ⚙️ **Modular design** for easy expansion with solvers, scramble generators, etc.
- 💻 **Cross-platform support** using GLFW for input and window handling
